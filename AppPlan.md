App overview
AlwaysGreener will serve as a landing page. When someone visits the site, they will enter some basic information, including their home and work zip codes. Based on that, they will be provided with information about where they live, including the day's weather, their commute time, and lunch recommendations. They will also receive the same information for another city, and be given the choice to answer whether that city seems better (or worse) than where they are currently located.
Ultimately, what we would like to do with this app is collect all the user data from each city, and use it to make an interactive world map. This map will show what cities residents of a particular city find most desirable. For example, a user who finds Los Angeles to be desirable will be able to select Los Angeles and see (as an example) that London is the 'greenest' city among LA residents.

Data visulization using D3. 
	Show the connection between cities. What are the top 5 'greenest' cities of (ex. Chicago)? Use D3 to show those connections.
	When a user selects one city, he or she should see a list of the top 'greenest' cities, according to residents of the selected city.
